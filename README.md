# Heart-attack-prediction

The silver lining is that heart attacks are highly preventable and simple lifestyle modifications(such as reducing alcohol and tobacco use; eating healthily and exercising) coupled with early treatment greatly improves its prognosis. It is, however, difficult to identify high risk patients because of the multi-factorial nature of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, et cetera. This is where machine learning and data mining come to the rescue.

Doctors and scientists alike have turned to machine learning (ML) techniques to develop screening tools and this is because of their superiority in pattern recognition and classification as compared to other traditional statistical approaches.

I will be giving you a walk through on the development of a screening tool for predicting whether a patient has 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease(CHD) using different Machine Learning techniques.
